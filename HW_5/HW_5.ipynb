As machines have evolved, so too has humanity's interest in Artificial Intelligence.\n",

With the advent of the computer, complexity and machine intelligence was increasingly easier to develop and thus Artificial Intelligence became more advanced than ever before. Serious concerns started to arise that these computers could, potentially, become more intelligent than we human beings given it is able to self-learn in a generalized way.\n",

        "This perfectly matched the 80s culture in the west and from it, social and entertainment value was gained. Movies, games, books, all forms of media and entertainment harped on the idea. From this massive public interest, funding was thrust into professional, academic research of Artificial Intelligence and its possibilities. This brings us to the computational domain of Artificial Intelligence.\n",

        "\n",
        "The computational field of Artificial Intelligence was created near the 1950s. It started with simple, automated algorithms to play chess, the famous Turing Test, and a bot that could play checkers which then developed into advanced Bayesian algorithms, industrial assembly line robots, semantic nets, path finding algorithms (dijkstra's, iterative deepening, DFS, best-first search), perceptrons, constraint propagation (forward checking, k-consistency, DPLL and Resolution), Huffman-Clowes Labeling, and an untold amount of other algorithms.\n",

But it needs to be determined *how much* to update the weights. We don't want to overshoot the optimal value, but if we undershoot too much, it could take us an eternity to find the optimal value.

        "In Deep Learning, models can be made to perform specific tasks. As mentioned before, we can use convnets for image classification, text prediction, NLP, among other things, but in order to get a model that performs a specific task, we have to do two core things: design the network and train it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say we want a network that can tell if a picture is of a cat or a dog. Since we only have two classes, we want a model that can perform binary classification. A model has two main parts: the conv base and the classifier. \n",
        "\n",
        "The conv base takes the given input (an image of a dog or cat in this scenario) and transforms/filters it in various ways. Each transformation is abstracted into something called a layer. These layers are chosen and placed to extract the features of the input that are important for our use case and update values called weights which fit our model to a given set of data through training. For example, we may want to reduce the entropy of our image for better and faster processing so we use some number of convolutional layers to achieve that end. Although, even Machine Learning experts largely use intuition when designing their own models because Deep Learning is very much like a black box. It's hard to know if a design will classify to the accuracy you need without experimenting with different layer types and combinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The classifier takes the processed input from the conv base and reduces it to our desired output. In this case, a single number that indicates if the input image contains a cat or a dog. The classifier is also abstracted in the form of layers but uses largely different layers than the conv base. Some notable ones include Flatten, Dense, Dropout, Batch Normalization, Softmax, Sigmoid, and ReLU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Designing a network is a lot of work, but thankfully, network designs can be generalized and used for many different, but similar tasks. These are called pre-trained networks. For instance, there are many different models for image classification and they all work quite well at classifying just about any object in any image; therefore building a network to classify pictures of dogs and cats is quite trivial. We simply choose from one of the well known image classification networks such as Xception, freeze some layers, train some others on images of dogs and cats and it's basically done, though we will get into that a bit later."

For example, most image-based pretrained models like Xception are trained on ImageNet--the largest and most representative general image dataset we have to date. This is great for users of pretrained networks because by default, pretrained networks already have a generalized understanding of image classification.\n",

The first layers of a network hold many abstract concepts of images which are useful and shouldn't be changed such as edges and shapes, therefore when training pretrained networks, we freeze the weights of the first layers. This improves regularization and classification accuracy. Of course if no weights change, training does nothing and we don't need to classify many objects as in the case of ImageNet, we only need to classify cats and dogs, so it is ok and good for the last layers of a network to be trained.\n",

        "In order to get a model to perform a specific task, we have to train it. When you train a model, you pass the model example data it can use to learn from and output the result you want. For example, we wish for our model to classify a given input image as having a dog or a cat, thus we train a model we've built with as many images as we can of cats and dogs, but we also have to tell the model what image has what classification so it knows how to update the weights. This data is called _truthed_ data. The data we feed it will have labels which indicate which images have dogs and which images have cats.\n",
        "\n",
        "After training a model and building it correctly, we should be able to pass in new images to test how well it is able to do the desired task. This part is often called _validation_ and helpfully most neural network frameworks do this incrementally and automatically as the model is trained. Like our training data, in order to vaidate, we must have input images and their truth, thus before training, it is recommended to take all truthed data and divide it up with 80% going toward training the network and 20% toward validating the network. This way we aren't testing the network based on data it has trained on which would give us _extremely_ warped results.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there is a problem here. A model is only good as the data it is fed. If we train and evaluate the model on images that are not representative of its final, production use case or conform to that specific data too much, then our model isn't as good as it can be. This is called _overfitting_.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we wish to reduce overfitting (aka regularize), there are a few things we can do. An obvious one is get truthed data as respresentative of the final use case as possible. This means a random sampling of potential inputs and labeling every one of those. If this is not possible, there is something called data augmentation. In data augmentation, we use existing data to create new data to train with. For example, we could reflect all cat and dog images on the y-axis. That would give us more data to train with and hopefully help us get closer to the production use case. Another way to regularize is to change the design of the model. There are types of layers that regularize better than others so those could be used instead. It has also been shown that reducing the complexity of a network, improves regularization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conversely, it's also important to not underfit. You don't want a model to generalize so much that it ruins its accuracy. This occurs with regularization so it's important to note there's a balance. Validation accuracy will decrease, but regularization will increase. A lot of this is subjective. Mess around with the parameters, try different things, gain intuition, and choose the configuration that seems to work best."
